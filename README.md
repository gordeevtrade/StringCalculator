# Calculator Console App
(.Net 6, File libary)

The Calculator Console App is a simple yet powerful tool developed in .NET 6.0 that can handle a variety of mathematical expressions. This application has two modes of operation, each designed to offer a flexible and convenient calculation experience.

Key Features:

Mathematical Expression Calculation: The application can calculate a wide range of mathematical expressions, such as "-2+2*3+(4.5-2/0.5)". It respects the standard mathematical operation precedence, giving accurate results.

Console-Based Operation: Users can directly enter the mathematical expressions into the console. The application instantly processes the expression and provides the result.

File-Based Operation: Besides console input, the application can also read mathematical expressions from a text file. Each line of the text file is interpreted as a separate mathematical expression, and the results are written to a different output file.

Error Handling: The application is designed to handle various exceptions, such as division by zero or invalid input, providing users with appropriate error messages.

The Calculator Console App effectively turns the console into a powerful mathematical tool, capable of interpreting and processing complex expressions. Whether you're working directly in the console or processing a file full of mathematical problems, this app delivers accurate results in an efficient manner.
